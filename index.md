<img class="profile-picture" src="photo_personal.jpg">

Hi, welcome to my academic homepage! I am Yao Zhou, a Ph.D student working in [Machine Intelligence Lab](http://www.machineilab.org), [College of Computer Science](http://cs.scu.edu.cn), [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn). My research advisor is [Prof. Yi Zhang](http://www.machineilab.org/users/zhangyi/).

Currently, I'm a joint Ph.D student studying in [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/), US, under the supervision of [Prof. Gary Yen](http://isc.okstate.edu/) and awarded by China Scholarship Council for a period of 18 months.

## Research Interest

My primary research areas are *deep neural networks(DNNs) and its applications* . I'm particularly interested in *biomedical image analysis* and *intellectual property (IP) data analysis*.
